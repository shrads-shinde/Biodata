    <h2>Introduction</h2><hr>
    <p>Last summer, I had the incredible opportunity to visit the <b>Himalayas</b> with my friends. It was a dream come true to witness the breathtaking scenery, feel the cool breeze, and experience nature at its best.</p>

    <h2>The Journey</h2><hr>
    <p>The trip began with a long road journey filled with music, laughter, and endless conversations. As we drove higher, the view became more mesmerizing. The sight of the snow-capped peaks, lush green valleys, and crystal-clear rivers** made every second of the trip worth it.My three days in Amritsar in the north western state of  the Punjab had been quite vibrant and I was expecting my next stopping off point, Dharmsala in the foothills of the Himalayas to provide a more serene atmosphere, if the meditative life style of its most famous resident, the Dalai Lama and his disciples was anything to go by.So picture it if you will, the lengthy seven-thousand foot ascent to Dharmsala, one long series of hair pin bends , constantly switching back on each other. There was not a robust crash barrier on the road’s edge in sight, to stop vehicles plunging down a hundred or thousand feet depending on the particular bend.My whole journey is described in on <a href="@anujayblogtravel.html">@anujayblogtravel.com</a></p>

    <h2>Afternoon Tea and Paradise</h2><hr>
    <p>Here, the few streets, or rather tracks, consisted largely of pastel wooden houses, decked out in the fauna and flowers that flourish at these heights – a setting beautiful enough to send any visitor into contemplative mode . Add to this the fantastic backdrop that is the snow capped start of the Himalayan mountain range.I put my camera away and sauntered along not staring at any particular house or person, trying to look like someone without a care in the world. My hope was that sooner or later someone would come out of a doorway or lean over a balcony and shout “Hey, mister? Where you from? You want chai?”.

Five minutes later I found myself sitting on a doorstep with a mother and her two daughters. The mother boiled a pan of water on the patio in front of us and baked a nan bread for me. In between rustling up these refreshments, she gave me an tour of the frugal interior of her two roomed bungalow. Her pride and joy were the framed photos of relatives that adorned one  wall. We retired back to the doorstep for an hour. Conversation was difficult but the feeling of hospitality strong and the view of the valley below and the snow capped mountains behind, bliss. I had found my own form of meditation here, just outside of Dharamsala – no need for all the nose piercing stuff to be able to appreciate this.You want more then click here <a href="aftertea.html">anujayblogtravel.com</a></p>

   <h2>Simila</h2><hr>
<p>On arriving in Simila, I settled myself down at the large Hotel Merva. This stood next to Christ Church, a building erected in 1857 which could have easily stepped into a Constable painting. I showered, crashed out onto the bed for a while (no taxi drivers to pay off this time) and reflected on the exhilarating ride. If ever I was to make the same journey again, I told myself, I would do so by taxi, enabling me to stop at will along the way whenever real beauty beckoned.
<img src="C:\Users\anuja\Downloads\sohaib-ghyasi-FxXiP82XQvc-unsplash.jpg" class="blog-image" style:width=10px; height=300px;>

But for now, I wondered if tomorrow would reveal a town still alive with testimonies to  British rule or was the best I could hope for, an obscure decaying relic of the Raj, down some side street?

Simla sprawls along a crescent shaped ridge, with its suburbs clinging to its slopes. Along the ridge runs the Mall, from which the British banned vehicles and until World War Two, all Indians. The cool light of day revealed a town centre which felt like a cross between Camberwick Green, the Cotswolds and a well preserved medieval settlement –  the post office and Ye Olde Town Hall, to name but two buildings along the Mall, could have been transported from a Bavarian hamlet from the middle ages.</p>

    <h2>Final Thoughts</h2><hr>
    <p>This trip taught me the importance of **adventure, friendship, and appreciating nature**. It was an experience that left me with memories to cherish forever.Traveling in the Himalayas is not just a journey—it’s an experience that transforms you. Here are some final thoughts on Himalayan travel experiences:

1. The Majestic Beauty Stays with You
The towering peaks, deep valleys, and pristine rivers create an awe-inspiring backdrop.
Every sunrise and sunset feels surreal, making you appreciate nature like never before.
2. The Challenge is Real, But Worth It
Trekking at high altitudes tests your physical and mental endurance.
Overcoming altitude sickness, rough terrain, and harsh weather makes the experience rewarding.
3. The People & Culture Leave a Lasting Impact
Warm hospitality from locals, whether in Ladakhi villages or Nepali teahouses, makes you feel at home.
Buddhist chants in monasteries, traditional festivals, and local cuisines add to the richness of the journey.
4. A Spiritual & Mindful Journey
Whether trekking to Everest Base Camp, meditating in Rishikesh, or visiting sacred temples, the Himalayas have a deep spiritual energy.
Many travelers find a sense of inner peace, reflection, or even transformation.
5. Adventure & Serenity Go Hand in Hand
From extreme trekking and mountaineering to yoga retreats and quiet village stays, the Himalayas cater to every kind of traveler.
Even in the most rugged landscapes, there’s a sense of tranquility and stillness that’s hard to find elsewhere.

<h2>My Whole Journey Of travelling Himalayas With Friends</h2><hr>
<p>My three days in Amritsar in the north western state of  the Punjab had been quite vibrant and I was expecting my next stopping off point, Dharmsala in the foothills of the Himalayas to provide a more serene atmosphere, if the meditative life style of its most famous resident, the Dalai Lama and his disciples was anything to go by.

I changed buses at Pathankot, from where the ascent to Dharamsala started in earnest. As we pulled out I realised that the three hour trip was going to be truly luxurious. I say this, not because of air conditioning, on board service or well upholstered seats. No, the key factor was much more basic  – the seat next to me was empty. Indeed so was half the bus. The situation I had anticipated was more akin to having to put my rucksack in the boot and stand up all the way, alongside one hundred other sardines. This was a rare find indeed – an Indian bus on which I could  sit down and place my rucksack on the seat next to me, where I could caress it when ever I so desired (you see it was a new rucksack). The Dalai Lama’s vibes were reaching out already. This was going to be a tranquil journey up into the snow capped foothills, oh yes!

So picture it if you will, the lengthy seven-thousand foot ascent to Dharmsala, one long series of hair pin bends , constantly switching back on each other. There was not a robust crash barrier on the road’s edge in sight, to stop vehicles plunging down a hundred or thousand feet depending on the particular bend.
<img src="C:\Users\anuja\Downloads\Himalayan-Retreat-4.jpg" alt=photo style:widht=10px; height:300px;><br>

I had already been in India one week, but this was my first serious journey by bus. However it was only a matter of minutes before I was reminded of that undying Indian faith in the concept of fate, particularly when applied to the twin notions of destiny and something called reincarnation. Put simply, it’s already written in the stars when and how each of us is going to depart this earth and the life form in which we shall return to it. So to hell with all this obsession about road safety – if you were meant to say cheery bye in a rather undignified manner, you’ll go that way, and if you weren’t, then no matter how much the bus driver tries to throw his vehicle of that cliff edge, it simply won’t happen.

So on our ascent, it was a case of foot to the metal. Forget the brake- the horn is an effective substitute. No worries that  the next hideous bend is but a few seconds away  – plenty of time to over take that truck and if we cause a horrendous accident in the process, then we won’t have to account to anyone in this life, as chances are we’ll be the ones who have gone over the side, aided and abetted by a driver with a death wish.

Near misses became the order of the minute, or if that feels like a bit of an exaggeration, then of the five minutes at most. In each case, as the zenith of our existence loomed, the driver pulled away from the edge, or finally launched into emergency stop mode, with what felt like a split second to spare.

For quite a while it really did feel like this fate thing was spot on. I did not know whether to thank the Lord or convert to Hinduism.

The good news, when our luck finally ran out, was that we were on the inside. Another bus came hurtling round the bend. As the opposing driver went to hastily correct his alignment, I thought ‘no way he make it this time’. Well he did, but by default, savagely scraping down the side of our bus, leaving it with a series of large dents down the side, shattering a couple of windows and not even stopping to inspect the damage.

Maybe the interior of the house had been spartan, but with the all round views that were on offer, who cared? Doubtless my host would have been horrified to have to eak out an existence in some suburban uniformly drab housing sprawl, where the best view was of the frontage of another uninviting house a few feet across the road.

Of course I could not leave without taking some group photos, both inside and outside the house. My host jotted down her address in Hindi. On my return to England, I put copies of these snaps into an envelope, pasted her jottings onto the front and wrote underneath …..” Near Dharamsala, Himachal Pradesh, India.” I truly hope that she received this, and who knows, that one of these pictures now hangs on that wall six-thousand feet up into them foothills.
